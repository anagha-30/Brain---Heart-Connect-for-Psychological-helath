# Brain---Heart-Connect-for-Psychological-helath
A Project that understands psychological health with a relational study of EEG and ECG signals. It also helps predict Heart attacks and rates involved with the same.

The Project has been taken as a reference from the 2018 IEEE paper: "DREAMER" by S. Katsigiannis, N. Ramzan.

## DETAILS:
### IDE: 
Jupiter Notebook
### Dataset: 
DREAMER Dataset
### Preprocessing: 
Neurokit
### Models used: 
AdaBoost, Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Neural Net, Naive Bayes
Visualization: Ploty, MatplotLib, Seaborn

## RESULT:
### 
Adaboost has a F score of 0.97 but the runtime was found to be 3.9ms
###
Nearest Neighbour has a F score of 0.86 but the runtime is 2ms.
###
AdaBoost has better accuracy while Nearest Neighbour has a better mean runtime.
